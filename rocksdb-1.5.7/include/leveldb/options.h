  // Comparator used to define the order of keys in the table.
  // Default: a comparator that uses lexicographic byte-wise ordering
  //
  // REQUIRES: The client must ensure that the comparator supplied
  // here has the same name and orders keys *exactly* the same as the
  // comparator provided to previous open calls on the same DB.
  const Comparator* comparator;

  // Default: false

  // If true, an error is raised if the database already exists.
  // Default: false
  bool error_if_exists;

  // If true, the implementation will do aggressive checking of the
  // data it is processing and will stop early if it detects any
  // errors.  This may have unforeseen ramifications: for example, a
  // corruption of one DB entry may cause a large number of entries to
  // become unreadable or for the entire DB to become unopenable.
  // Default: false
  bool paranoid_checks;

  // Use the specified object to interact with the environment,
  // e.g. to read/write files, schedule background work, etc.
  // Default: Env::Default()

  // Any internal progress/error information generated by the db will
  // be written to info_log if it is non-NULL, or to a file stored
  // in the same directory as the DB contents if info_log is NULL.
  // Default: NULL

  // -------------------
  // Parameters that affect performance

  // Amount of data to build up in memory (backed by an unsorted log
  // on disk) before converting to a sorted on-disk file.
  //
  // Larger values increase performance, especially during bulk loads.
  // Up to max_write_buffer_number write buffers may be held in memory
  // at the same time,
  // so you may wish to adjust this parameter to control memory usage.
  // Also, a larger write buffer will result in a longer recovery time
  // the next time the database is opened.
  //
  // Default: 4MB

  // The default is 2, so that when 1 write buffer is being flushed to
  // storage, new writes can continue to the other write buffer.
  // Default: 2

  // one open file per 2MB of working set).

  // Default: 1000

  // compression is enabled.  This parameter can be changed dynamically.
  //
  // Default: 4K

  // Compress blocks using the specified compression algorithm.  This
  // parameter can be changed dynamically.
  //
  // Default: kSnappyCompression, which gives lightweight but fast

  // Typical speeds of kSnappyCompression on an Intel(R) Core(TM)2 2.4GHz:
  //    ~200-500MB/s compression
  //    ~400-800MB/s decompression
  // Note that these speeds are significantly faster than most
  // persistent storage speeds, and therefore it is typically never
  // worth switching to kNoCompression.  Even if the input data is
  // incompressible, the kSnappyCompression implementation will
  // efficiently detect that and will switch to uncompressed mode.
