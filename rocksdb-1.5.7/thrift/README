This directory has the thrift server code that exposes leveldb apis.

The thrift api is specified in thrift/if/leveldb.thrift. 

The thrift header files are in ./thrift/lib. These are part of 
Apache Thrift code base and are needed for compilation of the leveldb
thrift server. The thrift libraries are copied into ./thrift/libs.
If you want to use a different version of thrift, please update these
directories with the corresponding thrift header files and the
compiled thrift libraries.

If you want to compile leveldb with thrift-server support, please set the following
enviroment variables appropriately:
   USE_THRIFT=1
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./thrift/libs:./snappy/libs
   make clean leveldb_server leveldb_server_test

You can run the leveldb server unit tests by
  ./leveldb_server_test

You can regenerate the thrift cpp files by doing the following

cd ./thrift
bin/thrift --gen cpp if/leveldb.thrift
